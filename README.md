 <li>Show how to implement a stack using two queues. Analyze the running time of the stack operations.</li>

 <li>Demonstrate what happens when we insert the keys 5, 28, 19, 15, 20, 33, 12, 17, 10 into a hash table with collisions resolved by chaining. Let the table have 9 slots, and let the hash function be <em>h</em>(<em>k</em>) = <em>k</em> <em>mod</em></li>

 <li>Consider a binary search tree T​ ​ whose keys are distinct. Show that if the right subtree of a node x​ ​ in T​ ​ is empty and x​ ​ has a successor y​ ​, then y is the lowest ancestor of x​ whose left child is also an ancestor of x​ ​.</li>

 <li>Describe a non-recursive algorithm for enumerating all permutations of the numbers {1, 2, …,n} using an explicit stack.</li>

 <li>Show that any n-node binary tree can be converted to any other n​ ​-node binary tree using <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>)</li>
